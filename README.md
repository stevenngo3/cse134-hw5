# Part 3
Originally, I had a border for the image of me in about.html set to 2px solid black in the style tag of about.html, but I moved this to styles.css so that the color would change depending on whether it was dark or light mode (border color is black on light mode and white on dark mode). This change creates a better user experience by adjusting to the user's preferred choice in the theme. I also added media query to improve the responsiveness on mobile which includes modifying the sizing of the project cards, improving the user experience for users on mobile.
